#PORTAL TOOL

Created in 2019 for work purposes, the tool was made to make life easier in my team. It consists of an aggregation of tools used in daily working tasks into one single page, easily accessible and looking like a portal.

This tool has been created from a Gatsby starter and then heavily modified with ReactJS. The visualization of the internal tools happens thanks to an iFrame. It's deployed (or served) directly on an Apache server.
